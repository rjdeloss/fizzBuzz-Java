[//]: # (1. Clone this repository)

[//]: # (2. Navigate to the directory saved on your computer on your terminal where the .java file is located.)

[//]: # (3. Execute `npm install` to install all of the project's dependencies.)

[//]: # (4. Run `npm run fizzbuzz <number>`)

## Instructions

FizzBuzz is a simple number game in which you count, but replace certain numbers with the words "Fizz" and/or "Buzz", adhering to certain rules. Given a number between 1 and 100, the app prints out the numbers 1 through 100, separated by newlines. Instead of numbers divisible by 3, the method should output "Fizz". Instead of numbers divisible by 5, the method should output "Buzz". Instead of numbers divisible by 3 and 5, the method should output "FizzBuzz".

## Final Thoughts
Although it wasn't as challenging, I learned about do loops which execute a statement until the desired condition is false when handling inputs.
